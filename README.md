# Schedule-planning
Final project of the subject Design and Analysis of Algorithms, 4th year of Computer Science, Faculty of Mathematics and Computing (MATCOM), University of Havana.

In this context, scheduling involves allocating limited resources (such as classrooms and teachers) to a set of activities (classes or exams) within a specific time frame. The goal is to create a schedule that minimizes conflicts (such as overlaps between classes) and maximizes efficient use of space and time. This problem presents multiple constraints, such as teacher availability and student preferences. Random conditions such as the possibility of missing classes due to events can also be considered.
